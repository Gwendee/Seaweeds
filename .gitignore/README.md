# Seaweeds
Seaweeds for daily living.
Seaweed is truly one of the sea's best gifts. It has been used as food, medicine, fertilizer and as raw material in production of industrial phycocolloids such as Carrageenan, Agar, and Alginate. 
The Philippines, being surrounded by the Pacific Ocean in the East, South China Sea in the West, and Celebes and Sulu Sea in the South, is one of the worldï¿½s top seaweed producing countries. Thus, farming of seaweeds is one of the most productive forms of livelihood benefiting thousands of coastal inhabitants in the country today. 
Marcel Carrageenan from its early years has been extensively involved in Philippine seaweed farming activities. Having a large network of farmers that expands the entire country, Marcel is now one of the largest exporters of Carrageenan bearing seaweed worldwide Eucheuma cottonii and Eucheuma spinosum. With its commitment to continuously contribute to the growth of the seaweed industry in the Philippines, Marcel intends to develop and explore the benefits of more Philippine seaweed products. Aside from Eucheuma cottonii and Eucheuma spinosum, new seaweed types such as Gracilaria are now included in Marcel's range of seaweed exports.
